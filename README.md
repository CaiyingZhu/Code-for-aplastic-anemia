R codes for downstream analysis of “Single-cell transcriptomics dissects hematopoietic cell destruction and T cell engagement in aplastic anemia”.
Details of scripts in each folder:

1.Seurat_HSPCs and Seurat_Tcells folders contain codes for quality control, single cell clustering, differentially expressed genes identification and cellular anaysis of HSPCs and T cells, respectively.

2.SCENIC folder includes codes for transcription factor and gene co-expression network construction, regulon activity of each single cell of HSPCs, single cell clustering base on regulon activity, and differential regulon activity analysis.

3.Cell-cell_interaction folder contains the scripts for downstream analysis of the output of cellphoneDB, a package for infering cell to cell communication.
